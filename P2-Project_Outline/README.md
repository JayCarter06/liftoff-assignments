## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I plan to create an app called "Cuisine Roulette". This app will allow users to login and search an area via location to find a group of restaurants and then spin the roulette wheel to have a randomizer select a place for them to dine. Cuisine Roulette will take the dilemma of where do you want to eat tonight out of the discussion. By selecting a general area where you would like to dine and spinning the wheel we can take the guess work out of date night. I came up with this idea through many discussion with friends about what do we wnat to eat tonight, and most of the time the conversation ended in many I don't cares. This app will cut down on time spent on making a decision and get you and your friends where you want to go sooner.
